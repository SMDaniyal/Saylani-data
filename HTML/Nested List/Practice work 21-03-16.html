                <h2>Pizza Recipe</h2>
                    <p>I love going to the Otto pizzeria in New York City for their delicious pizzas.  One of their pizzas is a mushroom pizza with taleggio cheese. I wanted to create my own version of it using puff pastry instead of regular pizza dough. I also wanted to create a puff pastry pizza that is a twist on pissaladiere. However, Instead of using black olives I wanted to add some Indian flavor.</p>
